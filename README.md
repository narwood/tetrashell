The world's most beautiful title screen:
"Tetrashell" appears in the flower-power ASCII art font from Patrick Gillespie's ASCII text generator. We pasted the text into a text file (flower.txt) to preserve the formatting, then read the file character by character inside tetrashell.c to print to stdout. The flowers were printed in yellow, and the text was printed in blue.
